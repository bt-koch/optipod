# Option Implied Probability of Default

The goal of this project is to estimate default probabilities of banks implied
by observed market data using the method suggested by
[Christian Capuano (2008)](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2008/194/article-A001-en.xml)
which was updated by [Johannes Vilsmeier (2014)](https://www.bundesbank.de/en/publications/research/discussion-papers/updating-the-option-implied-probability-of-default-methodology-703900).

## Data



## Statistical Framework

This project compares the traditional econometric approach of logit regression (with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, LASSO) to an implementation of random forest to build an early warning system signalling risk of fiscal stress.

## Results


## About

This project attempts to apply the updated method of estimating default probabilities
proposed by [Johannes Vilsmeier (2014)](https://www.bundesbank.de/en/publications/research/discussion-papers/updating-the-option-implied-probability-of-default-methodology-703900) on the most recent banking crisis in March 2023 and was created
as a part of the Seminar "Workshop in Econometrics II" at the University of Bern.
